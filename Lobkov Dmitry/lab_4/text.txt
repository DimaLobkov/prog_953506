There are fewer public holidays in Great Britain than in other European countries. They are Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Years Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, May Day, Spring Bank Holiday, and Summer Bank Holiday. Public holidays in Britain are called bank holidays, because the banks as well as most of the offices and shops are closed. The most favourite holiday is Christmas. The fun starts the night before, on the 24th of December. Traditionally this is the day when people decorate their trees. New Years Day is not such favourable in Britain than Christmas. But in Scotland Hogmanay, New Years Eve is the biggest festival of the year. Besides public holidays, there are some special festivals in Great Britain. One of them takes place on the 5th of November. On that day, in 1605, Guy Fawkes tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament and kill King James I. He didn't succeed. The King's men found the bomb, took Guy Fawkes to the Tower and cut off his head. Since that day the British celebrate the 5th of November. They burn a dummy, made of straw and old clothes, in a bonfire and let off fireworks. This dummy is called a "guy" (like Guy Fawkes).
